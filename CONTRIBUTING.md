# Contributing

Thank you for you contribution!

##  I develop on GitHub

I use github to host source code, docker images, track issues, and feature requests as well as accept pull requests.

## Using Github Flow

Pull requests are best way to propose changes to codebase. How to make your pull request?

1. For the repo and create your branch from `main` with following pattern `dev/<your-branch-name>`
2. Add some code
3. If you updated version of extensions or tools please update Readme file
4. Ensure the tests are passed
5. Issues that pull request!

### Commit messages guideline

For commit message use following pattern `<type> <short-summary>` where type is:

* **Add** when you adding new extension, tools, features
* **Update** when you updating dependencies (e.g. base image, tools, extensions)
* **Fix** when you fixing issues (e.g. failed docker builds)

When you need more text use new line and write text there. On github desktop application put this to description.

**Keep in mind that any contribution you make will be under the MIT Software License**

### Pull request title guideline

Using pattern similar to commits <type> <short-summary>` where type is:

* **Added** when you adding new extension, tools, features
* **Updated** when you updating dependencies (e.g. base image, tools, extensions)
* **Fixed** when you fixing issues (e.g. failed docker builds)

Please mention all realted issues in pull request message.

## Report bugs using Github issues

For tracking bugs I using Github issues. Great bug report tend to have:

* A quick summary
* Steps to reproduce
  * Be specific!
  * Post sample code if you can
* What you expected would happen
* What actualy hapens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use consistend coding style

* 2 spaces for intendation rather thatn tabs
